# Computer Architecture

Computers are one of, if not the most complex device humans have created.

Yet, I have not found a single resource that is able to clearly explain in detail how computers work **from the ground up**.

This repository is dedicated to help myself and other viewers get an in depth understanding on how traditional computers work. 

We start by breaking down how we go from materials to semiconductors, all the way up to having a functional Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages (MIPS). [10/22/2025]
